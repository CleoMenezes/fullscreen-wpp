### Load the extension in Firefox

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Firefox browser and navigate to `about:debugging`
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and from the file browser, choose
   `manifest.json`

## The Why

Maybe you're wondering "why would I need this extension if my monitor already
shows that WhatsApp™ Web is a full viewport". If you asked yourself this question
it means that you don't have the same hassle of seeing a small container on the
screen with chat since your monitor doesn't have a large aspect ratio.

This Add-on is primarily for personal use, however feel free to use it and
report any issues you encounter. :)

## Warning

This Firefox add-on is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or approved by WhatsApp Inc. The use of the name "WhatsApp" is for identification purposes only and does not imply any official relationship with the brand. The extension has been developed independently and aims to provide additional functionalities that are not related to the official WhatsApp service.
