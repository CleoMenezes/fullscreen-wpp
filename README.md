### Load the extension in Firefox

1. Open Firefox browser and navigate to `about:debugging`
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and from the file browser, choose `manifest.json`

## FYI

This add-on will constantly be updated as the name of the CSS element which is used by WhatsApp is changed several times. </br>
As this extension is primarily for personal use, if it eventually stops working, just make sure it's up to date, I'll have fixed it so it keeps working around here.
